Description : Compiles LP monad and expressions to a intermediate form.

Linear programs that are specified using the monadic construction are compiled
to an intermediate data structure that's easier to work with.  The compiled
state groups objective terms and splits (in)equality constraints into LHS and
RHS terms, with the LHS containing all variables and the RHS terms containing
fixed constants.
